BACKUP STATUS MONITORING POLICY

1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE

1.1 Scope
This policy applies to all information technology systems supporting retail grocery operations, including:
- Point-of-sale systems across all store locations
- Inventory management systems
- Financial reporting and accounting systems
- Customer relationship management databases
- Employee management systems
- Supply chain and vendor management systems
- Security and surveillance systems
- Website and e-commerce platforms

1.2 Purpose
This policy establishes standardized procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and responding to backup system status reports to ensure business continuity and data protection across all retail operations. The policy defines clear escalation paths and decision-making authority to minimize operational disruption while maintaining data integrity.

2. DECISION THRESHOLDS

2.1 Automated Response Acceptable (Green Status)
Automated systems may proceed without human intervention when:
- 95% or more of all scheduled backups completed successfully
- All critical systems (POS, inventory, financial) achieved 100% backup completion
- Backup completion time was within 120% of baseline performance
- No data corruption errors detected
- Available backup storage capacity remains above 25%

2.2 Standard Escalation Required (Yellow Status)
IT Operations Manager must be notified within 2 hours when:
- Between 85% and 94% of scheduled backups completed successfully
- Any critical system backup failed but alternate backup method succeeded
- Backup completion time exceeded 120% but remained under 150% of baseline
- Minor data integrity warnings detected (fewer than 5 instances)
- Available backup storage capacity falls between 15% and 25%

2.3 Immediate Escalation Required (Red Status)
IT Director and Operations Director must be notified immediately when:
- Less than 85% of scheduled backups completed successfully
- Any critical system backup failed completely with no successful alternate
- Backup completion time exceeded 150% of baseline performance
- Major data corruption detected (5 or more instances)
- Available backup storage capacity falls below 15%
- Two consecutive nights of backup failures for any system

3. APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Routine Operations (Green Status)
- IT Operations Technician: Authorized to acknowledge successful backups and file standard reports
- No additional approvals required for routine monitoring activities

3.2 Standard Response Actions (Yellow Status)

- Chief Operating Officer: Must approve activation of disaster recovery protocols or system rollbacks affecting multiple regions
- All emergency actions require dual approval from both IT leadership and business operations leadership

4. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS AND GUARDRAILS

4.1 System Protection Measures
- No more than two backup restoration attempts per system per 24-hour period without senior IT approval
- All backup recovery operations must be tested in isolated environment before production implementation
- Minimum 72-hour retention of previous backup versions before overwriting
- Mandatory verification of data integrity before declaring backup operations complete

4.2 Business Continuity Safeguards
- No backup maintenance activities during peak business hours (Friday 4 PM through Sunday 8 PM)
- All system changes require 48-hour advance notice to store management
- Emergency backup procedures must not interrupt POS operations during store hours

4.3 Data Security Requirements
- All backup status communications must use encrypted channels
- Backup failure notifications cannot include specific data content details
- Access to backup systems limited to authorized personnel with documented business need
- All backup access activities must be logged and reviewed monthly

5. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Daily Reporting
- Automated backup status summary report generated by 6:00 AM daily
- Report must include system-by-system completion status, timing metrics, and storage utilization
- All yellow or red status events must include root cause analysis within 24 hours
- Weekly summary report provided to IT Director and Operations Director every Monday

5.2 Incident Documentation
- All escalated backup issues require formal incident ticket with priority classification
- Standard escalation events must be documented within 4 business hours

5.3 Compliance Records
- Backup status logs retained for minimum 36 months for audit purposes
- All approval decisions must be documented with timestamp and justification
