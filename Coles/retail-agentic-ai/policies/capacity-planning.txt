Policy Number: IT-OPS-001
Effective Date: [Current Date]
Review Date: [Annual Review Date]
Department: IT Operations
Approved By: Chief Technology Officer

1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE

1.1 Scope
This policy applies to all IT systems supporting grocery retail operations including but not limited to:
- Point of sale systems
- Inventory management systems
- Customer relationship management platforms
- E-commerce and mobile applications
- Data storage and backup systems
- Network infrastructure
- Payment processing systems

1.2 Purpose
To establish standardized procedures for monitoring, predicting, and responding to system capacity constraints within a 30-day forecast window. This policy ensures business continuity, prevents service disruptions, and maintains optimal customer experience while controlling infrastructure costs.

2. DECISION THRESHOLDS

2.1 Automated Response Thresholds
Systems may automatically implement the following responses without human intervention:

Storage Systems:
- 65-74% capacity: Initiate automated data archiving of files older than 90 days
- 70-79% capacity: Enable data compression for non-critical archives
- 75-79% capacity: Automated cleanup of temporary files and system logs older than 30 days

Network Bandwidth:
- 70-79% utilization: Activate traffic shaping protocols
- 75-84% utilization: Implement bandwidth optimization for non-critical applications

Processing Power:
- 70-79% CPU utilization: Scale up cloud resources automatically within pre-approved limits
- 75-84% memory utilization: Restart non-essential background services

2.2 Human Review Required Thresholds
The following conditions require immediate IT Operations team review and manual decision-making:

Storage Systems:

Network Infrastructure:
- 85% or higher bandwidth utilization projected
- Latency increases above 15% baseline measurements
- Packet loss exceeding 0.1%

Application Performance:
- Response times exceeding 3 seconds for customer-facing applications
- Transaction processing delays above 2 seconds
- Any payment system performance degradation

2.3 Immediate Escalation Thresholds
The following conditions require immediate escalation to senior management:

- Any system projected to reach 90% capacity within 14 days
- Multiple related systems exceeding 80% capacity simultaneously
