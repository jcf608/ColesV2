- Point of Sale (POS) systems
- Inventory management systems
- Payment processing systems
- Customer relationship management (CRM) systems
- Supply chain management systems
- Security and surveillance systems
- Refrigeration monitoring systems
- Network infrastructure

- Backup and disaster recovery systems

1.3 Objectives
- Maintain 99.5% uptime for customer-facing systems during business hours
- Ensure rapid detection and resolution of system issues
- Minimize business disruption and revenue loss
- Protect customer data and transaction integrity
- Comply with regulatory requirements for system availability

2. DECISION THRESHOLDS

2.1 Automated Response Thresholds
Automated responses are authorized for the following conditions:
- System performance degradation between 5-15% below baseline
- Non-critical component failures affecting less than 10% of system functionality
- Routine maintenance tasks during scheduled maintenance windows
- Disk space utilization reaching 75-85% capacity
- Network latency increases of 20-50% above normal parameters

2.2 Manual Intervention Thresholds
Manual intervention is required when:
- System performance degradation exceeds 15% below baseline
- Any customer-facing system experiences downtime exceeding 5 minutes
- Payment processing errors exceed 2% of total transactions
- Security alerts indicating potential breach attempts
- Backup failures or data integrity issues
- Refrigeration system alerts affecting food safety

2.3 Emergency Escalation Thresholds
Immediate escalation to senior management is mandatory for:
- Complete system outages lasting more than 15 minutes during business hours
- Security breaches or suspected data compromises
- Payment processing failures exceeding 30 minutes
- Multiple critical system failures occurring simultaneously
- Any system issue potentially affecting customer safety or food quality

3. APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS

- Activation of disaster recovery procedures
- Public communications regarding system outages
- Decisions to operate with known critical system vulnerabilities

3.4 Emergency Authorization
During critical incidents, the on-duty IT Operations Manager may authorize immediate actions without prior approval, with mandatory reporting to the CTO within 2 hours of incident resolution.

4. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS AND GUARDRAILS

4.1 Customer Data Protection

4.2 Financial Transaction Safeguards
- Payment processing modifications require dual approval
- All financial system changes must maintain transaction logging
- Cash register reconciliation must remain functional during system maintenance
- Backup payment processing must activate automatically within 60 seconds

4.3 Food Safety System Protections
- Refrigeration monitoring systems must maintain continuous operation
- Temperature alert systems cannot be disabled without executive approval
- Food safety data must maintain 99.9% logging accuracy
- Backup power systems for critical food safety equipment must remain operational

4.4 Security Guardrails
- No system modifications may reduce existing security controls
- Security system bypasses require CTO approval and cannot exceed 4 hours
- All privileged access must be logged and monitored
- External vendor access must be supervised and time-limited

4.5 Operational Continuity Constraints
- No more than one critical system may be offline simultaneously except during emergency
- Customer-facing systems must maintain minimum 90% capacity during peak hours
- Backup systems must be tested and verified operational before primary system maintenance
- Store operations must maintain capability to process transactions manually if required
