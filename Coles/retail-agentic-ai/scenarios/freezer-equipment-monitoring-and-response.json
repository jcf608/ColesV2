The agent monitors freezer performance, assesses risk to frozen inventory, and coordinates immediate action plans including product transfers, repair schedules, and markdown decisions for compromised items.",
  "sample_questions": [
    "Freezer unit 3 is showing 15°F instead of -5°F - what's our immediate action plan for the $8,000 of frozen goods inside?",
    "The walk-in freezer has been down for 2 hours and repair won't arrive until tomorrow - which products need emergency markdowns?",
    "Temperature alarm went off overnight in freezer section - how do I assess what inventory is still sellable versus total loss?"
