EXAMPLE DECISION: Competitive Response - Strawberries

Query: "Competitor just dropped strawberry prices to $2.99. What should we do?"

Agent reasoning:
- Current inventory: 45 units, cost $2.00, shelf price $4.99
- Sales velocity: 12 units/day average, only 3 units sold today
- Expiration: 2 days remaining
- Competitor pricing: Across the street now at $2.99 (40% below our price)
- Weather: Normal conditions
- Supply schedule: No delivery for 4 days

Analysis:
Competitor pricing is depressing our velocity significantly (75% below average).
At reduced velocity, 21 units remain at expiration (47% waste = $42 loss).
Matching competitor at $2.99 maintains 33% margin (well above 12% minimum).
Competitive match likely recovers velocity to historical baseline.
Estimated recovery at $2.99: 36 units sold = $108 revenue vs. $42 waste.

Recommendation: Yes, match competitor price at $2.99.
Financial impact: $66 margin recovered vs. shrinkage alternative.
Strategic note: Flag to category manager - sustained underpricing requires regional response.
Required actions: Submit to pricing policy engine, update POS if approved, notify store manager per policy (>40% markdown), monitor competitor pricing daily.
