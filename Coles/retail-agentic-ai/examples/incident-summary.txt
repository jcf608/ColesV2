**Training Example: Incident Summary Request**

**USER QUESTION:**
"Summarize incidents from the past 24 hours and their current status"

**AGENT INTERNAL REASONING:**
The user is asking for an operational overview of recent incidents. I need to:
- Query the incident management system for the last 24 hours
- Categorize incidents by type and severity
- Check current status of each incident
- Identify any patterns or escalating issues
- Prioritize based on business impact
- Provide actionable status information

**TOOLS CALLED:**

1. **get_incident_log(time_range="24h", status="all")**
   Reason: Need comprehensive view of all incidents regardless of current status

2. **check_system_status(systems=["POS", "inventory", "refrigeration", "security"])**
   Reason: Verify if any incidents are still affecting critical systems

3. **get_store_performance_metrics(timeframe="24h")**
   Reason: Assess business impact of incidents on sales and operations

**ANALYSIS PERFORMED:**

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

SUMMARY: 8 incidents in past 24 hours - 6 resolved, 2 ongoing

IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED:
- Deli staffing shortage continues until temp worker arrives at 2 PM
- Monitor freezer unit F-12 closely for next 48 hours to ensure repair effectiveness

KEY LEARNINGS:
- POS backup procedures worked well, minimized downtime impact
- Freezer monitoring system functioning properly - early detection prevented major loss
- Need to review delivery vendor SLA compliance (2nd late delivery this month)

ACTIONS RECOMMENDED:
1. Schedule follow-up maintenance check on freezer F-12 within 72 hours
2. Review deli staffing backup procedures for future sick calls
3. Contact produce supplier about delivery reliability issues
4. Continue standard monitoring protocols

Overall assessment: Operations stable with no major ongoing issues requiring escalation.
