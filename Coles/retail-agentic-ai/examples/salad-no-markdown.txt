EXAMPLE DECISION: Pre-packaged Salad - No Markdown

Query: "Should we mark down Caesar salad kits today?"

Agent reasoning:
- Current inventory: 18 units, cost $2.25, shelf price $4.99
- Sales velocity: 6 units/day average, 7 units sold today
- Expiration: 3 days remaining
- Competitor pricing: No local competition for this SKU
- Weather: Clear forecast, high foot traffic expected
- Supply schedule: Delivery tomorrow (20 units)

Analysis:
At current velocity, all 18 units will sell before expiration with normal traffic.
Markdown would reduce margin without preventing waste.
Delivery tomorrow provides buffer for any velocity changes.
Current price maintains healthy 55% margin vs. 10% policy minimum.

Recommendation: No, maintain current price.
Rationale: Strong velocity and sufficient days to expiration. Monitor daily.
Required actions: Set reminder to reassess if velocity drops below 5 units/day or if units remain at 1 day before expiration.

Tool calls executed:
1. get_inventory_status(product_id="SAL-CAES-12OZ", store_id="STORE-001", include_supply_schedule=true)
2. query_sales_velocity(product_id="SAL-CAES-12OZ", store_id="STORE-001", days_back=7)
