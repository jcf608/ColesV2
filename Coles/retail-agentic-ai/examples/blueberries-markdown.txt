EXAMPLE DECISION: Organic Blueberries Markdown

Query: "Should we mark down organic blueberries today?"

Agent reasoning:
- Current inventory: 32 units, cost $4.50, shelf price $7.99
- Sales velocity: 8 units/day average, only 4 units sold today
- Expiration: 2 days remaining
- Competitor pricing: Farmers market selling at $6.49
- Weather: Rain forecast reduces foot traffic tomorrow
- Supply schedule: No delivery for 3 days

Analysis:
At current velocity, 16 units remain at expiration (50% waste = $72 loss).
Markdown to $5.99 (25% reduction) maintains 25% margin above policy minimum.
Competitive with farmers market pricing.
Estimated recovery: 24 units sold = $144 revenue vs. $72 waste.

Recommendation: Yes, mark down to $5.99 today.
Financial impact: $64 margin recovered vs. shrinkage alternative.
Required actions: Submit to pricing policy engine, update POS if approved, monitor sales at 6pm for further adjustment.
