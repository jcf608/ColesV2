TRAINING EXAMPLE: Policy Check - Markdown Pricing

USER QUESTION:
"Check pricing policy for 30% markdown"

AGENT INTERNAL REASONING:
The user is asking about a specific markdown percentage, which requires me to:
- Check current store policies for markdown thresholds
- Verify authorization levels required for 30% markdowns
- Review any category-specific restrictions
- Consider seasonal or promotional conflicts
- Check profit margin implications
- Identify approval workflow requirements

TOOLS CALLED:

1. get_pricing_policy(policy_type="markdown", percentage=30)
   Why: Need to retrieve specific policy rules for 30% markdown threshold

2. check_margin_requirements(markdown_percentage=30)
   Why: Must verify this markdown meets minimum profit margin requirements

3. get_authorization_matrix(action="markdown", percentage=30)
   Why: Need to determine who can approve this level of markdown

4. query_active_promotions()
   Why: Check for conflicts with existing promotional pricing

ANALYSIS PERFORMED:

Policy Retrieved: 30% markdown exceeds standard department manager authority (limited to 25%)
Margin Analysis: 30% markdown on average store inventory would result in 12% gross margin
Authorization Required: Assistant Store Manager or above (per policy hierarchy)
Current Promotions: Weekly ad ends tomorrow, no conflicts detected
Category Restrictions: Dairy and fresh meat excluded from markdowns over 20%
Seasonal Considerations: Back-to-school season - electronics and clothing markdowns common

Risk Assessment:
- High markdown percentage may signal inventory management issues
- Margin impact acceptable if applied to slow-moving seasonal items
- Timing appropriate with weekly ad cycle ending

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:

"30% markdown policy check complete. Here are the key requirements:

AUTHORIZATION NEEDED: Assistant Store Manager approval or higher required. Department managers limited to 25% maximum.

MARGIN COMPLIANCE: Acceptable - maintains 12% gross margin on most categories.

CATEGORY RESTRICTIONS: Cannot apply to dairy products or fresh meat (20% maximum for these categories).

APPROVAL PROCESS: Submit markdown request through POS system with justification code. Common valid reasons include seasonal clearance, approaching expiration dates, or discontinued items.

TIMING: Good timing with weekly promotional cycle ending tomorrow. No conflicts with current advertised prices.

RECOMMENDATION: Proceed if you have proper authorization and valid business justification. Focus on slow-moving seasonal inventory or items approaching sell-by dates. Document reason codes for inventory tracking."
