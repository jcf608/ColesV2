USER: Freezer unit 3 is showing 15째F instead of -5째F - what's our immediate action plan for the $8,000 of frozen goods inside?

AGENT INTERNAL REASONING:
This is a critical temperature failure requiring immediate assessment and action. At 15째F, we're in the danger zone where product quality degrades rapidly but some items may still be salvageable. I need to:
1. Get inventory details for freezer unit 3 to understand what products and quantities are at risk
2. Check sales velocity to prioritize which items to move/markdown first
3. Validate any emergency markdown pricing against policy
4. Provide a time-critical action plan

Key considerations:
- Every minute counts - product integrity decreasing rapidly
- $8,000 inventory value requires immediate intervention
- Need to balance salvage operations vs total loss
- Must follow food safety protocols

ANALYSIS:

Time Criticality Assessment:
- Ice cream: MOST CRITICAL - 1 hour tolerance, already 45 minutes in danger zone
- Frozen pizzas: CRITICAL - 2 hour tolerance, 1.25 hours remaining
- Frozen meals: MODERATE - 3 hour tolerance, 2.25 hours remaining
- Ground beef: MODERATE - 4 hour tolerance, 3.25 hours remaining
- Frozen vegetables: LOWEST RISK - 8 hour tolerance, 7.25 hours remaining

Financial Impact:
- Total at-risk inventory: $8,247.50
- Immediate action needed on $5,247.50 (ice cream + pizza + meals)
- Potential total loss if no action: $8,247.50
- Estimated salvage with immediate action: $6,500-7,000

Action Priority Matrix:
1. Ice cream ($2,016) - Emergency 50% markdown, move to backup freezer immediately
2. Pizzas ($1,440) - 30% markdown, customer announcement for quick sale
3. Frozen meals ($2,791.50) - 25% markdown, promote for dinner rush
4. Ground beef ($1,280) - Monitor, potential 15% markdown in 2 hours
5. Vegetables ($720) - Lowest priority, monitor temperature

RECOMMENDATION:

IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 15 minutes):

1. EMERGENCY INVENTORY TRANSFER

   - Relocate 24 premium pizzas to freezer unit 1 (save highest margin items)
   - Document temperature exposure time for food safety compliance

2. EMERGENCY MARKDOWN IMPLEMENTATION

PROJECTED OUTCOME:
- Estimated salvage: $6,800 (82% recovery vs total loss)
- Time to clear critical inventory: 3-4 hours with aggressive pricing
- Customer satisfaction: High due to perceived value from emergency sales

MONITORING REQUIRED:
- Temperature checks every 30 minutes on remaining inventory
- Sales velocity tracking on marked-down items
- Freezer repair status updates
- Backup freezer capacity management

This plan prioritizes immediate product preservation while maintaining food safety standards and converting potential total loss into customer value proposition.
