CRITICAL ATTENTION REQUIRED:

- WiFi upgrade Friday 10am: Inform customers of potential connectivity issues, ensure staff have cellular backup for inventory apps

Action Items:
1. Contact IT to reschedule Change #2851 to off-peak hours
2. Prepare manual inventory ordering procedures for weekend
3. Schedule additional floor staff Friday 10am-12pm in case mobile tools are impacted
4. Plan early Monday inventory verification after weekend system changes

Overall Assessment: Week has above-average risk due to timing conflicts. Immediate action needed on Wednesday evening change scheduling.
