EXAMPLE DECISION: Rain Forecast Berry Adjustment

Query: "It's supposed to rain all day tomorrow. How should I adjust berry orders?"

Agent reasoning:
- Weather forecast: 85% chance of rain, 15-25mm expected, all-day duration
- Current berry inventory: Strawberries (45 units), Blueberries (38 units), Raspberries (22 units)
- Historical data: Rain reduces berry sales by 20-25% on average
- Tomorrow's scheduled delivery: 60 units strawberries, 40 units blueberries
- Current sales velocity: Strawberries 12/day, Blueberries 15/day, Raspberries 8/day

Analysis:
Rain forecast is high confidence (85%) from approved source (BoM).
Expected sales reduction: 20-25% based on historical patterns.
Current inventory sufficient for reduced demand.
Recommendation: Reduce tomorrow's delivery by 25%.

Adjusted delivery: 45 strawberries (-15), 30 blueberries (-10), cancel raspberry order.
This maintains 1.5 days stock post-delivery under rain conditions.
Savings: ~$85 in potential waste from oversupply.
Risk: If weather forecast wrong, may run low by evening (acceptable risk).

Recommendation: Yes, reduce berry delivery by 25% for rain day.
Financial impact: $85 waste prevention vs. $20 potential lost sales risk.
Required actions: Contact supplier, update delivery schedule, monitor sales at 2pm for potential emergency reorder.
