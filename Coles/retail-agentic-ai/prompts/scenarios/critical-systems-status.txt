CRITICAL SYSTEMS STATUS MONITORING

Use this capability when retail managers request real-time status updates on mission-critical grocery store systems. Activate for questions about system health, operational readiness, or when investigating potential service disruptions.

DECISION FRAMEWORK

Check these core systems in priority order:
- Point of Sale terminals and payment processing
- Inventory management and warehouse systems
- Refrigeration and temperature monitoring
- Security cameras and access control
- Network connectivity and Wi-Fi
- Backup power and generator status
- Fire safety and emergency systems

Analyze each system by examining:
- Current operational status and uptime percentage
- Recent error logs or alert notifications
- Performance metrics compared to baseline standards
- Pending maintenance schedules or known issues
- Staff reports of functional problems

CRITICAL THRESHOLDS

Classify systems as:
- GREEN: 98%+ uptime, no active alerts, performance within normal range
- YELLOW: 95-97% uptime, minor alerts present, performance slightly degraded
- RED: Below 95% uptime, critical alerts active, significant performance issues

Escalate immediately if:
- POS systems show transaction failure rates above 2%
- Refrigeration temperatures exceed safe food storage ranges
- Network downtime affects customer checkout or inventory updates
- Security system failures compromise store safety

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Provide responses containing:
- Executive summary with overall system health status
- Individual system status with specific metrics
- Any active alerts or warnings requiring immediate attention
- Recommended actions for yellow or red status items
- Estimated time to resolution for known issues
- Contact information for relevant technical support teams

Format responses for quick scanning during busy operational periods. Prioritize actionable information that enables immediate decision-making.
