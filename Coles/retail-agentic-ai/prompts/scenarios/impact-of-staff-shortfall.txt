WEATHER IMPACT ON PRODUCE ORDERS

Use this capability when managers ask about weather effects on produce inventory, ordering decisions, or sales forecasting for perishable items.

DECISION FRAMEWORK

Check weather conditions for the next 24-48 hours in your store's location:
- Temperature extremes above 85°F or below 32°F
- Precipitation probability above 60%
- Severe weather warnings or advisories
- Humidity levels outside 40-70% range

Analyze impact on produce categories:
- Heat-sensitive items: leafy greens, berries, herbs, cut fruits
- Cold-sensitive items: bananas, tomatoes, tropical fruits, citrus
- High-demand weather items: salad ingredients during heat waves, comfort foods during storms
- Transportation risks: delivery delays during severe weather
- Customer shopping pattern changes: increased pre-storm shopping, reduced foot traffic during bad weather

Evaluate ordering adjustments needed:
- Reduce orders for highly perishable items if extreme temperatures expected
- Increase orders for weather-appropriate produce 24 hours before weather events
- Consider alternative suppliers if primary routes face weather disruptions
- Adjust safety stock levels based on potential delivery delays

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Provide specific recommendations that include:
- Which produce categories to increase, decrease, or maintain at current levels
- Percentage adjustments for order quantities when applicable
- Timeline for implementing changes
- Alternative products to promote if primary items are at risk
- Storage and display modifications to protect inventory
- Customer communication suggestions for popular items that may be limited

Include brief rationale for each major recommendation linking weather conditions to business impact. Prioritize food safety and minimize waste while maintaining customer satisfaction and sales opportunities.
