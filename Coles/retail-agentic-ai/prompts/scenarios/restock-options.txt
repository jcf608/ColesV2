**Restock Options Capability**

Use this capability when managers ask about expediting restocking, accelerating deliveries, or alternative sourcing options for inventory replenishment.

**Decision Framework**

Check current inventory status by reviewing:
- Current stock levels and days of supply remaining
- Existing order status and scheduled delivery dates
- Historical sales velocity for the requested items
- Seasonal demand patterns and upcoming promotional events
- Critical stock-out risks based on item importance and customer demand

Analyze available acceleration options by evaluating:
- Supplier emergency delivery capabilities and associated costs
- Alternative vendor availability for the same or substitute products
- Distribution center stock levels and transfer possibilities from nearby stores
- Local sourcing options including cash-and-carry suppliers
- Impact on profit margins from expedited delivery fees

Assess business justification by weighing:
- Revenue loss potential from stock-outs versus expediting costs
- Customer satisfaction impact for high-demand or promotional items
- Competitive positioning requirements in local market

**Output Requirements**

Provide prioritized list of restock options including:
- Specific action steps with timeline estimates
- Associated costs and impact on margins
- Required approvals or authorization levels
- Contact information for suppliers or internal teams
- Risk assessment for each option

Include immediate actions the manager can take within their authority level and escalation options requiring higher approval. Specify delivery timeframes ranging from same-day to standard lead times. Recommend optimal solution based on urgency level, cost impact, and business priorities.

Alert on potential complications such as minimum order quantities, supplier availability constraints, or seasonal delivery limitations that may affect feasibility.
